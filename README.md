# Joaquim's Profile

### Hi! Welcome to my github page!

My name is Joaquim, I have a background in Aerospace Engineering, with a Masters from University of Bristol. Despite my background, I pivoted my career towards Data Science. One of the main reasons I changed paths is because I love coding and programming, and I try to apply my knowledge into real life problems. I am currently on my way to be a proficient Data Scientist, so I enrolled into the AI Core fellowship, which trained us to in the creation and deployment of AI, including building data pipelines, data cleaning, deep learning, cloud, CI/CD and more<br>

Among my main set of skills, I would highlight:<br>

🐍 Python <br>
🔧 Engineering <br>
📊 Machine Learning <br>
🤖 Deep Learning (Tensorflow and Pytorch) <br>

I hope you like my github page, this is a collection of my personal projects as well as some projects that I worked along with some colleagues in Univeristy, the IBM Data Science Certificate and the AI Core fellowship.<br>
