# Joaquim's Profile

### Hi! Welcome to my github page!

My name is Joaquim, I have a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Bristol, and despite my background, I am currently trying to pivot my career towards Data Science. 
One of the main reasons I changed paths is that I love coding and programming, and I try to apply my knowledge to real-life problems. 
Consequently, through the AI Core Data Science program and the IBM Data Science Certificate, I have gained training in various aspects of AI, including building data pipelines, performing data cleaning, analyzing data, creating visualizations, working with deep learning, utilizing the cloud, and implementing CI/CD.<br>

## Programming Languages:

Python / Matlab / SQL / C / C++ (Arduino)

Some of the main tools I would highlight too are:
